**🌦 Weather Data Analysis – City Comparison Dashboard**

**📌 Project Overview**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow applied to weather data. Using the OpenWeatherMap API, the pipeline collects real-time weather information for multiple cities, processes it with Python and Pandas, stores it in a SQL database, and visualizes insights through Power BI dashboards.
The goal is to showcase how data analysts can transform raw API data into actionable insights that help compare weather conditions across regions.

**🔑 Key Features**
- Data Extraction: Automated API calls to fetch weather metrics (temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall).
- Data Transformation: Cleaning, formatting timestamps, handling missing values, and aggregating city-level statistics.
- Data Loading: Storing structured data into a SQL database (SQLite/PostgreSQL).
**- Reporting:** Interactive Power BI dashboard with:
- 🌡 Temperature trends across cities
- 💧 Humidity and rainfall comparisons
- 🌍 Map visualization of weather conditions

**🛠 Tech Stack**
- Python (Requests, Pandas, SQLite3)
- SQL (SQLite/PostgreSQL for structured storage)
- Power BI (for dashboards and reporting)

**📊 Business Use Case**
Weather insights are critical for industries like agriculture, logistics, and tourism. This project simulates how organizations can monitor and compare weather conditions across regions to make better operational decisions.

**🚀 Learning Outcomes**
- Hands-on experience with API integration.
- Building a data pipeline with Python and SQL.
- Creating interactive dashboards in Power BI.
- Understanding real-world applications of weather analytics.
